&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happened-in-2022&quot;&gt;What happened in 2022?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting year to say the least. On the surface, it looked like an amazing year, but under the hood, it was a rollercoaster of highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let‚Äôs start with a list, here‚Äôs what went down in 2022 (in no particular order)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tried the keto diet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launched a software startup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launched this blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quit my job&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coded up a storm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Got super depressed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Started going to therapy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Injured my leg&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Started putting down books&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Got COVID&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visited 4 new countries, and Paris for the first time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Went to my first Indian wedding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Got a Turkish bath&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ran with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheesh! Highs and lows indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022 was a year of major transition for me as I &lt;a href=&quot;https://eddymikes.me/2022/08/07/quitter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quit my job&lt;/a&gt; and embarked on the path of entrepreneurship. Likely inspired my newly acquired ‚Äúfree agent‚Äù status, I conducted my first personal annual review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise was motivating, clarifying, and stress-reducing. It brought closure to 2022, helped me recompile a lot of what I learned, and gave me a firm handle on how I want to navigate 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-personal-annual-review&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justinwelsh.me/blog/setting-anti-goals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tim.blog/2021/12/27/past-year-review/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; that I cherry picked from to structure my annual review if you‚Äôre interested in doing your own. Highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I selected a few pieces of my review to expand upon for this post. Let‚Äôs dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2022-goal-review&quot;&gt;2022 Goal Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022 was my first year of setting and tracking specific goals for the year. I tried to limit big goals to 1 or 2, and tacked on a few easier ones. Despite not hitting all of them, they kept me very focused during my day-to-day‚Ä¶ constantly asking myself whether things were truly necessary to advance me towards one of these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚úÖ &lt;strong&gt;Read 12 books.&lt;/strong&gt; I discovered audiobooks and blew this one out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚úÖ &lt;strong&gt;Re-read 2 books.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚úÖ &lt;strong&gt;Launch personal blog.&lt;/strong&gt; We know how that turned out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ùå &lt;strong&gt;Build an app that I or my friends use.&lt;/strong&gt; Overly ambitious given the state of my coding skillset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ùå &lt;strong&gt;Launch a revenue-generating startup.&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôm coming to find that things take MUCH longer than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-already-knew-but-learned-through-experience-in-2022&quot;&gt;Things I already knew, but ‚Äúlearned‚Äù through experience in 2022&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you experience something for the first time that you already knew was a thing, it can give you a new appreciation for or understanding of that thing. Thinking about my year through this lens was a fun exercise, so I plan to do this every year going forward. Here are my big ones from 2022:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;Burnout is real&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always thought of relentless energy and motivation as one of my greatest strengths. I‚Äôve heard people talk about how motivation comes in waves, but I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to never have experienced that. Until 2022, I can‚Äôt think of a time when my motivation ever really waned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was a combination of launching a startup, working a full time job, learning to code, and just being in my early thirties that caused me to experience real burnout for the first time. Burnout was this thing that I always heard about, but just assumed didn‚Äôt apply to me, so I never really thought about how to avoid or manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs hard to put the feeling into words, but my tangible sense of motivation vanished for a period during early 2022. Not great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that it forced me to take a break and relax. Sure enough, the motivation came back after a few weeks. The whole experience was unpleasant enough to learn a few lessons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trying to be productive all the time is counterproductive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Breaks are incredibly important&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accomplishing a little bit each day is more sustainable and effective in the long run than trying to chain together massively productive long hour workdays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to be more mindful of these in 2023. I‚Äôm not an invincible 20 year old anymore! (hopefully I look back on these days as being an invincible 30 year old üòé)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;Depression is real&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022 was my first year experiencing proper depression. Until I reached my early 30s, I‚Äôve always been a consistently happy and energetic guy. Objectively, my life has been and is very good, and 2022 was full of many great experiences. Nonetheless, a confluence of factors related to my career and lifestyle sent me into a funk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a good portion of the year, I was pretty consistently sad (or at least just not happy) whenever there wasn‚Äôt a positive exogenous stressor in my life like going on a trip, going out with friends, or visiting family. There were definitely more bad days than good ones in 2022, which was kind of a shocking realization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lows often hurt more than the highs feel good, and the intensity of depression still takes up a disproportionate amount of my memory of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, like burnout, I always knew that depression was a thing, but kind of just assumed it wouldn‚Äôt happen to me. Experience makes you appreciate it for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally started going to therapy (after MUCH persuasion from Sarah). It‚Äôs early days, but talking to someone who is just there to listen and react objectively seems to help, and I‚Äôm in a pretty good headspace going into 2023. Who woulda thunk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;Sales is hard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is shockingly difficult to get people to part with their money.&lt;/strong&gt; I could have told you that a year ago, but in 2022, I experienced it firsthand trying to win early customers for my startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always thought of myself as a good salesperson since I have an innate ability to get other people excited about things. When I‚Äôm excited about something, people are generally convinced and become excited about it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I finally got a reality check: in a pure sales context, with no company, brand, product or reputation behind you, the bar is so much higher. The entire demeanor of the room changes when it comes time for the prospect to part with their money, or even just agree to something. The creativity of excuses I received never ceased to amaze me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, a lesson in entrepreneurship being about getting people to take action (and having a high rejection tolerance!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;Hiring is hard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was intimately involved in the process to hire my replacement after resigning at work. This was much harder than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the first decade of my career swinging through the jungles of finance, which involved many highly competitive interview processes. From where I was sitting back then, it always seemed like getting hired was the real challenge and that hiring companies had their pick of the lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was eye opening to experience the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pressure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of finding the right candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a candidate, the consequences of not getting any individual job are inherently limited since you can always interview with another company. But &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;hiring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the wrong person can be value subtracting and negatively impact the company in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you do get it wrong, the problem cannot be resolved quickly given the time it takes to conclude someone is not a good fit, run another search/interview process, and onboard the replacement. Searching for and interviewing candidates is a very considered process, and there is a lot of pressure to hire the right person. More than I anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I could have told you this a year ago, but experiencing the higher stakes really hit it home for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few additional takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The talent pool was worse than I expected.&lt;/strong&gt; I always felt like my finance interview processes were super competitive and that I swimming in an ocean of uber-qualified candidates. Sitting on the other side of the table, I was disappointed by the majority of candidates we saw. Clearly a case of the grass being greener on the other side. Regardless of whether it‚Äôs a buyer‚Äôs or seller‚Äôs labor market, it‚Äôs competitive on both sides of the table.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I used to think it was unfair to not get feedback&lt;/strong&gt; on why I didn‚Äôt advance to the next round of interviews. I see now that it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to give every candidate feedback on why they didn‚Äôt advance. This is due to both time constraints and passing on many candidates for something as simple as a poor case study submission early in the process. I still tried to pass along feedback to as many as I could.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiring biases are real.&lt;/strong&gt; I was hiring for a client-facing role where excellent verbal and written English is critical. Non-native English speakers (or those without excellent English) are at a de facto disadvantage, regardless of how talented or hard-working they may be. This can come through during interviews and in written assessments, and it is unfortunately difficult to mentally adjust for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;American Ninja Warrior is hard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered a random ninja warrior park when I was visiting Tel Aviv this past summer. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and tried almost every obstacle. Impossible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew it was hard, but experiencing it gave me new respect for those warriors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;best-books-i-read-in-2022&quot;&gt;Best books I read in 2022&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not part of my annual review, but I felt compelled to share these bangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CCP2VWX/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&amp;amp;tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burn Rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is a book about mental illness under the cover of the Bonobos origin story. I have a new appreciation for the implications of bipolar disorder. Easily the most fascinating book I read in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended-ebook/dp/B014DUR7L2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2PPJ2HCTPE287&amp;amp;keywords=never+split+the+difference&amp;amp;qid=1673415614&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sprefix=never+split+the+differ%2Cdigital-text%2C463&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Split The Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Recommended to me by a good friend as the ‚Äúbest negotiating book he‚Äôs ever read‚Äù. While this is the only negotiating book I‚Äôve read, it was excellent‚Ä¶ to be referenced for years to come. It was written by the former head of hostage negotiation for the FBI and is full of high stakes stories of real life negotiations. Super practical. ‚ÄúHow am I supposed to do that?!‚Äù (if you know, you know)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Music-Got-Free-Obsession-ebook/dp/B00OZ0TKL6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2E1P5RG83PUME&amp;amp;keywords=how+music+got+free&amp;amp;qid=1673415571&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sprefix=how+music+got+fr%2Cdigital-text%2C435&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Music Got Free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A detailed account of the digital piracy revolution of the late 1990s and 2000s. A fun trip down memory lane to my days using Kazaa and LimeWire in middle school. Spyware, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Who-Michael-Ovitz-ebook/dp/B07B2HS77M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=20SA29K9QVPYF&amp;amp;keywords=who+is+michael+ovitz&amp;amp;qid=1673415644&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sprefix=who+is+michael+ovitz%2Cdigital-text%2C396&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is Michael Ovitz?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The memoir of a Hollywood super-agent. Especially interesting if you‚Äôre into movies and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Tokyo-Vice-American-Reporter-Vintage-ebook/dp/B002RYXA0Y/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1IBXGG4XTWLYQ&amp;amp;keywords=tokyo+vice&amp;amp;qid=1673415668&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sprefix=tokyo+vice%2Cdigital-text%2C414&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tokyo Vice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Tales from an American reporter covering the police beat in 1990s Japan. It‚Äôs an unbelievable story, and the author is a great storyteller. Beware, it gets dark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2023-goal-setting&quot;&gt;2023 Goal Setting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working through my 2022 annual review inspired me to be even more deliberate about setting goals for 2023. Publishing them online seemed like a good way to hold myself accountable üí™.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to set a few big goals that 1) are important to me, and 2) serve as milestones to achieving even bigger goals in the future. For each big goal, I also set a handful of ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-annual-planning-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;checkpoint goals&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù and put some systems in place to set myself up to hit them (e.g. 1 hour of coding, 4x per week). I also set some simple reading and writing goals just to keep me on course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to nail in 2023:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üéØ &lt;strong&gt;Write 6 blog posts.&lt;/strong&gt; 1 per quarter felt like too little, 1 per month felt like too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üéØ &lt;strong&gt;Read 13 new books.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üéØ &lt;strong&gt;Re-read 2 books.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üéØ &lt;strong&gt;Achieve full shoulder width body squat with heels on floor.&lt;/strong&gt; My ankle mobility sucks. This will set the foundation to achieve more advanced fitness goals down the road (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üéØ &lt;strong&gt;Build an app that solves a problem for me.&lt;/strong&gt; I have a side project I‚Äôm working on. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üéØ &lt;strong&gt;Get 10 paying customers for my startup.&lt;/strong&gt; Big goal #1. 10 customers would represent proof-of-concept and significant revenue, but it‚Äôs not completely outlandish. This also sets me up to achieve big goal #2‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üéØ &lt;strong&gt;Raise money for my startup.&lt;/strong&gt; Big goal #2. Successfully raising in 2023 is a good barometer for our targeted level of growth and is required to scale into 2024 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I piggy-backed off this annual goal-setting inspiration to set some &lt;strong&gt;longer term fitness goals&lt;/strong&gt; as well. There is no ‚Äúdue date‚Äù on these. Just guiding North Stars for what I‚Äôm working towards long term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20 pull ups (dead hang)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Upper body strength&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Deadlift body weight 10 reps&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Total body strength&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eOrqGTpv6o&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nordic curl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Posterior strength&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Hang from a bar - 2 min&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Grip strength&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Wall sit - 2 min&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Lower body strength&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDcniqddTeE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pistol squat&lt;/a&gt; each leg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Lower body mobility&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn8mqlG0nkE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Overhead squat&lt;/a&gt; body weight 1 rep&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Total body strength/mobility&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5 min cycle w/watt output at 1.5x body weight&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Cardiovascular fitness&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I anticipate these taking several years to achieve at a pace that will avoid injury. Off we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-cool-thing-i-discovered-in-2022&quot;&gt;A cool thing I discovered in 2022&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I‚Äôd leave you with this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.futureme.org/letters/new&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Futureme&lt;/a&gt;. This website lets you send a letter to your future self (they email you the letter at a specified time in the future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a letter to myself in five years and one to myself in 10 years. I plan to write one to my 80 year old self as well. Pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there it is. A little late getting this one out, but we did it. I hope you found something useful or inspiring in this post. Onward to discovering more cool things in 2023!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#things-that-had-a-significant-impact-on-my-productivity&quot;&gt;Productivity hacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#my-productivity-vices&quot;&gt;My productivity vices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve spent a lot of time thinking about productivity. This is probably because I inherently hate wasting time, but partially because I‚Äôm taking a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eddymikes.me/2022/08/07/quitter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;risky turn&lt;/a&gt; in life. Maximizing my productive output has become more important commensurate with the higher stakes I‚Äôve set for myself. Spend two minutes scrolling through the Twittersphere, and it‚Äôs clear that productivity is a topic of general interest, so I felt inspired to consolidate my thinking around how I stay productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before getting into the obligatory ‚Äúhacks‚Äù list, it‚Äôs important to mention that all the productivity tips and tricks don‚Äôt really matter if you‚Äôre working on the wrong thing or are not genuinely interested in what you‚Äôre doing. Unless you‚Äôre superhuman, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to give it everything you‚Äôve got when you‚Äôre working on something you don‚Äôt care about. Motivation is extremely sensitive to interest in both directions. Sam Altman expands on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;well&lt;/a&gt;, so I won‚Äôt reinvent the wheel here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start with two of my big &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;productivity no-nos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; up front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;productivity-no-no-1-the-optimization-trap&quot;&gt;Productivity no-no #1: The Optimization Trap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing so much on how to be more productive that it becomes counterproductive.&lt;/strong&gt; Essentially just over-optimizing. Productivity hacks are seductive, so this is a slippery slope. Admittedly, I‚Äôve found myself here before, but I try to be self-aware about whether I‚Äôm falling into the trap in real time. The majority of productivity hacks offer only marginal benefits, and sometimes you just need to get going on whatever it is you‚Äôre working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;productivity-no-no-2-the-grind-trap&quot;&gt;Productivity no-no #2: The Grind Trap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blindly focusing on ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù and number of tasks completed.&lt;/strong&gt; I call it the ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;grind trap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù. Productivity is not just about efficiency, it‚Äôs about impact. You can use energy efficiently to run on a treadmill, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going anywhere. It sounds obvious, but it‚Äôs an easy trap to fall into mainly because grinding out tasks tends to be less cognitively demanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending all morning advancing slightly on a super impactful project is often more productive in the long run than cranking out a bunch of to-do list items. But smashing through your to-do list feels good and is usually easier. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there will always be times to just sit down and bang stuff out, but generally speaking, measuring your productivity by number of tasks completed without thinking about their impact on your medium-to-long term goals is not value maximizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre really ‚Äúproductive‚Äù at doing things that shouldn‚Äôt be your first priority, you aren‚Äôt really being productive, and the opportunity cost is high! A little bit of time spent on something each day grows into an enormous amount of time spent on it in the long run (see ‚Äúday compounding‚Äù below). So consistently getting caught in the grind trap can magnify into massive productivity losses over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to avoid the grind trap by constantly asking myself whether I‚Äôm actually being productive or just ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;active&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù (I even set up a little reminder post-it note that stares me in the face all day). A good mental model for this is the ‚Äúrun up-hill‚Äù framework, which says that when torn between two paths, it usually pays to choose the one that‚Äôs more difficult in the short term. On balance, the more intellectually demanding tasks tend to be the more impactful ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs hard to do, but just remember, we humans are momentum fiends: force yourself to take that difficult first step, and every one after that becomes significantly easier. This blog post is a great example. I‚Äôve been putting it off for days because it was easier to jam through other less demanding tasks on my list!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-compounding-and-sustainable-productivity&quot;&gt;Day compounding and sustainable productivity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has never been more in-vogue to talk about compounding. I hate to follow the crowd here, but it‚Äôs true. Not just financial compounding, but the compounding effects of how you spend your time. This works to your advantage in almost every area of life, from fitness and relationships to learning and productivity. If you can gain one more productive hour per workday, in a year, that‚Äôs 260 hours. In five, that‚Äôs 1,300 hours. The long term impact of small but consistent productivity gains is massive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generating productivity gains that compound is only possible if your methods are sustainable. I‚Äôve found the easiest way to do this is to seek methods with a high &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;impact-to-ease of implementation ratio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Whatever you do to be more productive, it should be relatively easy to implement and keep doing, and it should have an outsized positive impact on your productivity. Like with anything in life, finding these involves a lot of trial and error, and there may be some minor productivity losses in the pursuit of productivity gains. Everybody has different things that work for them, so don‚Äôt be afraid to give something a shot even if it doesn‚Äôt seem suitable to you at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve tried a lot of methods over the years and have come up with a pretty reliable list that works for me. As promised, this wouldn‚Äôt be an article on productivity without a ‚Äúhacks‚Äù list, so without further ado‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-had-a-significant-impact-on-my-productivity&quot;&gt;Things that had a significant impact on my productivity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;thanks-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick disclaimer: It‚Äôs important to maintain some degree of flexibility in your workflow. I try to do a lot of these things as regularly as possible, but life comes at ya. Being arbitrarily rigid is counterproductive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;‚ö° Setting a daily to-do list the night before&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot promote this one enough. I understand how this could seem trivial, what‚Äôs wrong with setting your daily to-do list first thing in the morning? The answer: a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting your daily to-do list involves choosing from a larger list of to-dos, then prioritizing. We‚Äôre not talking rocket science here, but this is an important and somewhat thoughtful exercise. Setting your daily to-do list first thing in the morning means the first thing you do is spend time &lt;em&gt;contemplating and making a decision&lt;/em&gt;. Setting your daily to-do list the night before means the first thing you do is &lt;em&gt;take action&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to spend my peak mental hours immediately diving into meaningful work that requires high impact decision making, not making a decision about how to spend my day. Setting your daily to-do list the night before lets you avoid a small, but momentum-sucking decision and allows you to start your day by immediately executing on what you‚Äôve already decided upon doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how humans are momentum fiends? This one falls in the category of ‚Äúgetting out of your own way‚Äù by kickstarting the momentum train. Same deal with laying out your gym clothes the night before, so you can just roll out of bed, put them on, and head straight to the gym. Do yourself a favor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daily to-do list for this past weekend looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/notion-daily-to-do-list.png&quot; alt=&quot;notion-daily-to-do-list&quot; title=&quot;notion-to-do-list&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely does anything ever make it onto the ‚Äúmission critical‚Äù list. If something is truly mission critical, I will literally not do anything else until that thing is complete. Most things aren‚Äôt mission critical by this definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to limit the ‚Äútop priority‚Äù list to a maximum of two items. These tend to be more cognitively demanding and impactful tasks, but don‚Äôt have to be. My criteria for something to be ‚Äútop priority‚Äù are urgency and impact. The ‚Äúif possible‚Äù bucket is for less urgent things that are still relatively important in the near term. This to-do list structure is essentially my own version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eisenhower Matrix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise is usually the last thing I do before ‚Äúsigning off‚Äù of work for the evening. I do it most days, and once before the weekend if I have some stuff to get done. If I‚Äôm caught up on things or not particularly busy, I‚Äôll skip it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;‚ö° Getting up super early&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting up early has two main benefits for me: 1) it maximizes distraction-free peak mental hours, and 2) it minimizes ‚Äútime slippage‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My peak mental hours are between waking up and lunch time, and everything after that is a steady decline. The world comes online around 8-9am, and distractions start to roll in. Waking up earlier shifts more of my peak mental time into the distraction-free zone. The productivity benefits are self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn‚Äôt until I started regularly waking up early that I realized &lt;strong&gt;time slippage is EVERYWHERE&lt;/strong&gt;. I define time slippage as the difference in time required to do something if it‚Äôs done early versus later in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are just a few annoying examples of things that take longer if done later in the morning with some conservative time loss estimates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The gym is more crowded (lose ~10 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The elevator is more crowded and makes more stops (lose ~3 minutes, depending on the size of your building)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There‚Äôs more traffic, or the subway is slower/more crowded (lose ~10 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are other dogs on the street distracting my dog from peeing so the walk takes longer (lose ~10 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four examples alone would cost me ~30 minutes a day of my most mentally productive time. That‚Äôs more than a workday per month that I can get back just by waking up earlier! Of course this isn‚Äôt exact math, and everyone‚Äôs routine is different, but it‚Äôs directionally true: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;waking up early literally buys you time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the gains compound: an hour at 6am is worth much more to me than an hour at 10am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the distraction-free time and minimized time slippage, there‚Äôs also the motivation derived from knowing you‚Äôre crushing the day. It‚Äôs cringy but true. Don‚Äôt knock it ‚Äòtil you try it üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm generally in bed around 9pm and wake up at 5am, snoozing to between 5:10 and 5:20 (though sometimes much longer). I tried pulling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bob Iger&lt;/a&gt; and waking up at 4:45am, but I couldn‚Äôt swing it. He‚Äôs a machine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One caveat: I fully acknowledge that I am a morning person through and through. Some people aren‚Äôt and do their best work late into the night. Waking up early isn‚Äôt for everyone. It‚Äôs more important to structure your workday around your peak mental hours rather than arbitrarily waking up early simply because it‚Äôs associated with being productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;‚ö° Adopting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; to organize my life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a BIG one. I‚Äôm constantly surprised by the number of people who haven‚Äôt heard of Notion, despite it being a massively successful software startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notion is a cloud-based documents app, super charged with useful functionality, wrapped into a simple and customizable folder structure&lt;/strong&gt;. What Notion does for my level of organization makes me constantly think ‚Äúwhere have you been all my life?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notion can be used for &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; anything, but here are a few personal examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;no-bullet-list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚òëÔ∏è To-do lists&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚òëÔ∏è Any other kind of list&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚òëÔ∏è All note-taking (forget Evernote)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚òëÔ∏è Writing, collaborating on, and sharing documents&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚òëÔ∏è Event planning / guest list tracking&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚òëÔ∏è Project management&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚òëÔ∏è Travel planning&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚òëÔ∏è Saving articles&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚òëÔ∏è Recording workouts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚òëÔ∏è Drafting blog posts üòâ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this stuff is simply organized into one place, with a bunch of embedded functionality. &lt;strong&gt;It‚Äôs like outsourcing part of your brain.&lt;/strong&gt; Notion is one of those things that‚Äôs so simple and works so well, that you can‚Äôt help but ask yourself: ‚Äúhow did this not exist 10 years ago?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and there‚Äôs a great mobile app, so all of your stuff is at your fingertips on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a Notion account can be a little intimidating. The application is infinitely flexible, and all the functionality choices can be a bit overwhelming. There‚Äôs also no shortage of YouTube gurus out there promoting the most optimized and sexy personal dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt worry about all that. Start small, and see if it‚Äôs for you. Some people prefer a good ol‚Äô handwritten to-do list, and that‚Äôs fine too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to not be completely biased, here are the only things I‚Äôve found that Notion is not great for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;no-bullet-list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚ùå Anything that‚Äôs done best in Excel (don‚Äôt come at the King!)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚ùå Cloud file storage&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;‚ùå Calendar functionality (although they plan to integrate with Google Calendar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;‚ö° Ignoring email&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot take alert! This one is both critical and controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of focus you will achieve by ignoring email entirely for three hours at a time is hard to understate. Email is an attention stealer, and most emails do not require an urgent response (I‚Äôm sure there are some fields where this isn‚Äôt the case, but I‚Äôll venture to guess there are few). And yet, we‚Äôre carpet bombed with these little things all day long, constantly breaking our focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúBut wait! How can you ignore email?!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What if someone needs to get in touch with you?!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Aren‚Äôt you negatively impacting your teammates‚Äô productivity?!‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. I solve for this in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the relevant people know how to contact you for urgent matters. Either via text, call, internal/external company chat, etc. Don‚Äôt be off grid, just don‚Äôt be constantly breaking focus to check your inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand that if something is truly urgent, the person will find a way to get in touch with you. If you‚Äôre contactable, but they can‚Äôt figure out how to reach you, it‚Äôs not urgent enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skim your email three times a day for urgent messages only, then block off 30 minutes to one hour once per day to go through your entire inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days tend to be more email-heavy, and it‚Äôs hard to avoid, but I try to systematically skim and ignore email as often as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-little-productivity-hacks&quot;&gt;Other little productivity hacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;‚ö° Drinking less&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one should be obvious. It‚Äôs amazing how many things in life fall into place when you cut down on alcohol. Energy, focus, cleanliness. The list is endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;‚ö° Uncomfortably cold showers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there‚Äôs one thing that gets rid of brain fog in the morning better than anything else, it‚Äôs a freezing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq6WHJzOkno&amp;amp;t=2093s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cold shower&lt;/a&gt;. The water should be so cold you can barely tolerate it, then stand in it for two full minutes (set a timer). Never has two minutes felt so much like an eternity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit, it‚Äôs miserable, but the benefits are real for me. I get out of the shower extremely energized, and the mental clarity often lasts for hours. I only do this once or so per week since it‚Äôs so unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;‚ö° Switching from coffee to green tea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the peaks and troughs of coffee‚Äôs caffeine buzz to be relatively extreme, and they always have me coming back to the machine for another espresso. By the early afternoon, I‚Äôve already had two or three espressos, and I‚Äôm entering ‚Äúmore coffee will disrupt my sleep‚Äù territory. I end up forced into this groggy state in need of more caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter green tea. I find that green tea‚Äôs caffeine buzz is longer lasting than coffee‚Äôs, with less pronounced peaks and troughs. I don‚Äôt get jittery, and the crash is more of a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù, allowing me to stay focused for longer. I also end up consuming less caffeine overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll usually have a cup in the early morning, maybe another in the late morning, then one after lunch if necessary. I also love matcha. Throw a little almond milk and turmeric in there, pro tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not religious about this and will have a coffee here and there since I love the taste so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;‚ö° Intermittent fasting and low carb lunches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting (‚ÄùIF‚Äù) is widely promoted on the health and fitness circuit these days. For me, IF just entails eating an early dinner and skipping breakfast a few times per week. This creates a fasting window of around 14 to 16 hours, which is commonly referred to as the 16-8 fasting method (16 hours of fasting, 8 hours to eat your meals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are alleged &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;health and longevity benefits&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôm not promoting those. I do it for two productivity-related reasons: 1) I don‚Äôt have to think about making and eating breakfast, and 2) I feel better and am more focused for longer through lunchtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming I‚Äôve gotten a good night‚Äôs sleep, my mental acuity is higher, and my morning energy is more consistent when I‚Äôm fasting. I try to extend this by keeping weekday lunches very low in carbs to avoid the afternoon crash. It works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: If you get so hungry that you can‚Äôt think straight, this defeats the purpose, and you should just eat. I also don‚Äôt fast after big strength training workouts. Read up on the risks of fasting before you try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;‚ö° Stop reading the news&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news is a doom-scrollable list of headlines and stories jockeying for your eyeballs, 99% of which do not matter to your life (this excludes careers that require following certain news very closely).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre worried about not knowing what‚Äôs going on in the world, don‚Äôt be. If something is important enough, unless you are a bona fide recluse, there is a 100% chance you will hear about it, and hearing about it first matters zero. If your goal is to be ‚Äúinformed‚Äù and sound smart, read books or long form deep dives on topics you‚Äôre interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to a few newsletters that blast out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.execsum.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of the top headlines, and I‚Äôll take a minute to skim through that. If something really important or interesting happened, I‚Äôll dig into it further, but this is rare. I used to spend 30 minutes to an hour a day doom-scrolling through the news, the majority of which I didn‚Äôt retain. Waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;‚ö° Building in time to screw around and do nothing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is less of a hack, and more something I think is simply necessary. Burnout is real, and if you‚Äôre trying to be productive all the time, this will quickly work against you. I‚Äôve been there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre human beings with a finite capacity for mentally demanding work each day. If you spend too much time draining your mental gas tank for too long, your overall level of cognitive performance and motivation will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt be afraid to relax. Working hard is important, but slipping into ‚Äúhustle culture‚Äù is counterproductive in the long run. Build in time to hang with friends, spend time outside, or sit around and watch TV to let your brain reset, like taking a rest day after a workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-productivity-vices&quot;&gt;My productivity vices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some people it‚Äôs procrastination, for others it‚Äôs chocolate. For me, it‚Äôs YouTube, Twitter, and the snooze button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;üêå YouTube&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I LOVE YouTube. It‚Äôs longer form and is usually more informational than Instagram, but still bite-sized enough to use during a short break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had a nickel for every time I cracked open a video with the intention of watching one or two, but found myself an hour later down some unexpected rabbit hole‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;üêå Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one can be scary since it‚Äôs ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù and doom-scrollable. A dangerous cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs hard not to keep scrolling after you open it, and there‚Äôs so much garbage interspersed throughout the good content that Twitter scrolls can be pretty mindless if you‚Äôre not selective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I request to see less of certain people or topics regularly (akin to ‚Äúunsubscribing‚Äù), but I still find Twitter scrolls sucking up an unnecessary amount of my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-section&quot;&gt;üêå Snooze button&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is less of a vice and more of an Achilles Heel. In bad cases, I‚Äôve been known to snooze in 15 minute increments for up to two hours. Brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how well-rested I am, I‚Äôm fully addicted to hitting snooze. All will power evaporates in the critical moment, and it costs me in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone knows how to conquer this one let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to ruthlessly narrow it down and leave you with three things to take away from this post: &lt;strong&gt;use &lt;a href=&quot;http://notion.so&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, wake up early, and set your to-do list the night before&lt;/strong&gt;. Drinking less gets an honorable mention üòÇ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey, that‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôm always open to trying out the latest magic hack, so hit me up if you think you‚Äôve found the secret sauce!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;thanks-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Sarah for reading a draft of this post.

I quit my job. Cue the ‚Äúwhat have I done!?‚Äù tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just joking. This wasn‚Äôt a rash decision. In fact, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been thinking deeply about for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm 31 with 9 years of experience in finance. Things have been going smoothly, or at least they appear to be from the outside looking in, but the recent reality has been an internal struggle as I face a growing dissatisfaction with my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial allure of working in finance wore off after my first few years, and the dissatisfaction started creeping its way in, ultimately morphing into full blown unhappiness over the last 2-3 years. After a hell of a lot of introspection, I‚Äôve come to be much more critical of my choices and my career, and I have more clarity than ever before about what‚Äôs important to me in life. This all culminated in the decision to leave finance and go it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell this story, let me run it back to ancient days of 2012‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my career in investment banking for a few reasons. I don‚Äôt know if they were the right ones, they probably weren‚Äôt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wanted to learn a lot (about anything, just a lot)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wanted to ‚Äúcredentialize‚Äù my CV&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Money&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My friends were doing it, and I identified with the culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three out of four reasons revolve around one theme: preserving optionality. Knowing nothing about finance and having no idea what I wanted to do in life, that rationale seemed somewhat sensible, so I dove in. Almost a decade later, it‚Äôs clear that I wasn‚Äôt being intellectually honest about who I am, where my true interests lie, and what I (maybe) should be doing with my life‚Ä¶ stubbornly ‚Äúpreserving optionality‚Äù at all costs without thinking critically about these things. I can chalk it up to immaturity, lack of experience, or just not knowing until I know, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the last 9 years moving through various sub-sectors of finance, two things occurred to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was never organically excited about what I was doing.&lt;/strong&gt; Every manifesto will tell you requirement #1 for being happy and successful in life is to love what you do. Ask anyone who knows me - I am an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; enthusiastic person by nature. This never came through in my work. Big red flagüö©&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My absolutely highest performing state occurred when I was out of a job and out there hustling&lt;/strong&gt; to get hired by companies that felt out of my reach (in one case after already having left my job). My cognition and drive were on another level. I‚Äôve worked on a handful of side hustles over the years and noticed the same thing. Something about the personal risk, upside, and lack of a salary safety net combined with pure organic interest unlocked something within me. This isn‚Äôt all that surprising, but sometimes it just hits home after the fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These realizations took me deeper down the introspection rabbit hole: How can I better spend my time to maximize my happiness and realize my full potential? What do I even like? What do I even want in life?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I distilled it down to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freedom.&lt;/strong&gt; Not being a slave to my job. Living the lifestyle I want. Living in a state of pure meritocracy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to travel, live a comfortable healthy life, and have a big family.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doing something impactful.&lt;/strong&gt; Having some sort of direct positive impact on other people or the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what am I good at? More importantly, what am I good at that is relatively unique?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to prevent this post from becoming one big pat on the back, I‚Äôll leave it here: I energize others, I can &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;schlep&lt;/a&gt; like the best of them, and I‚Äôm decisive (I can ‚Äúpull trig‚Äù, for better or worse).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it dawned on me one day. I have been gravitating directly towards entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I watched my dad run his own business, and I had in the back of my mind that I‚Äôd also work for myself one day. Unfortunately, I did not think that deeply about how to realize that future back then, and the underlying desire to build something of my own was eventually diluted by the distractions of college and the allure of finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just assumed this would be my future. I never allowed myself to recognize that taking action was not only within my power, but a requirement. It only took a decade of experience and deep reflection to trigger that line of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm working on a startup in Hong Kong, and we have a stable product getting positive early feedback from customers. But we haven‚Äôt found product market fit and are not cash flow positive (although we have a modest burn rate). Some may say I‚Äôm derisked enough to take the leap, others may say I‚Äôm not even close. This is where risk tolerance becomes a matter of perspective. But regardless, even if this project wasn‚Äôt getting traction and I didn‚Äôt see a path to profitability, I‚Äôd quit my job anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognize the importance of derisking decisions, but I also believe in the importance of leaning into your strengths and positioning yourself to get lucky. I‚Äôm not advocating that people recklessly hang their hat on getting lucky without a plan. That‚Äôs akin to gambling. I‚Äôm highlighting the importance of putting yourself on the right side of luck relative to your current position, within the limits of calculated risk taking. Consider your current position versus the position you‚Äôll put yourself in and what that will do to your chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not superhuman and am pretty incapable of delivering the required level of focus when my peak mental hours are consumed by a day job. It‚Äôs also the leap itself that pushes me to my maximum productive output, so in my case, maintaining the status quo is anything but positioning myself to get lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I‚Äôm well-positioned to succeed, and there are things I can do to further nudge the odds in my favor, including building passive income and maximizing my ‚Äúat bats‚Äù through many small, controlled bets, but at the end of the day, I genuinely believe in myself enough to take the leap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that‚Äôs where we are. After all that fancy introspection, it pretty much comes down to a good old entrepreneurial itch. And some itches must be scratched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you gotta burn the boats and bet on yourself. Away we go.&lt;/p&gt;

Here goes nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this blog for three reasons: &lt;strong&gt;1) clear writing = clear thinking, 2) exploring unknown unknowns, and 3) accountability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clear-writing--clear-thinking&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear writing = clear thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend the vast majority of my intellectually demanding time consuming information and content, rather than producing/creating it. Books, podcasts, blogs, articles, my Twitter feed, YouTube videos‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pretty much a one way street of information input. That information represents the building blocks of my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating ideas from thoughts into comprehendible written words challenges us to more deeply understand what we think. It‚Äôs amazing how I‚Äôll think I know something and try to write it out, and that exercise reveals how hollow that thinking can be. There are other areas of life where I write - occasionally at my day job, for startups/side projects I‚Äôve worked on, job hunts, and so on, but it‚Äôs pretty infrequent. Forcing myself to write more stimulates another part of my brain, reinforces and challenges my ideas, and improves the depth and quality of my thinking (if I was on the fence about that before, writing this first post proves it to me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is a pursuit of clearer, deeper thinking about the things that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a rough idea of what I plan to write about (entrepreneurship/business, health &amp;amp; fitness, learning, productivity, travel/living abroad, anything else I come to be interested in), but I‚Äôm excited to see where this goes. Which brings me to my next reason‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exploring-unknown-unknowns&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring unknown unknowns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas beget ideas. I don‚Äôt understand the brain chemistry behind this, they just do. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll uncover or what ideas will occur to me by challenging myself to write more, but I know I‚Äôll uncover something. It would be cool to see what that‚Äôs all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accountability&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accountability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could just write in a journal, but there‚Äôs something about the act of posting online for the world to see. We‚Äôre not talking about high stakes here, but it does hold me to a higher standard. The internet is &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forever&lt;/a&gt;, so there‚Äôs an incentive to really think through what I‚Äôm writing about‚Ä¶ clear writing = clear thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the main reasons, but this is also another fun coding challenge! I‚Äôm picking up programming on the side, and a personal blog or website is a great early practical application of that skillset. This blog is completely self-developed and hosted using GitHub Pages, Jekyll, basic HTML/CSS, and Namecheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, despite having read it for some time, I only just noticed that a high school friend of mine has been running his &lt;a href=&quot;https://blas.com/essays/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;awesome blog&lt;/a&gt; for what appears to be the exact same reasons! One inspiration point to you, my friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-in-a-name&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What‚Äôs in a name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúE Mikes‚Äù, ‚ÄúEddy Mikes‚Äù or many variations thereof was given to me as a nickname in high school, and it‚Äôs stuck ever since. Keepin‚Äô it rolling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And BOOM! First blog post complete. Stay tuned for more, I hope you enjoy reading!&lt;/p&gt;
