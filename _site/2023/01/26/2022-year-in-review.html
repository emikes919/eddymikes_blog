<h2 id="what-happened-in-2022">What happened in 2022?</h2>

<p>An interesting year to say the least. On the surface, it looked like an amazing year, but under the hood, it was a rollercoaster of highs and lows.</p>

<p><strong>Let‚Äôs start with a list, here‚Äôs what went down in 2022 (in no particular order)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Tried the keto diet</li>
  <li>Launched a software startup</li>
  <li>Launched this blog</li>
  <li>Quit my job</li>
  <li>Coded up a storm</li>
  <li>Got super depressed</li>
  <li>Started going to therapy</li>
  <li>Injured my leg</li>
  <li>Started putting down books</li>
  <li>Got COVID</li>
  <li>Visited 4 new countries, and Paris for the first time</li>
  <li>Went to my first Indian wedding</li>
  <li>Got a Turkish bath</li>
  <li>Ran with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain</li>
</ul>

<p>Sheesh! Highs and lows indeed.</p>

<p>2022 was a year of major transition for me as I <a href="https://eddymikes.me/2022/08/07/quitter.html" target="_blank">quit my job</a> and embarked on the path of entrepreneurship. Likely inspired my newly acquired ‚Äúfree agent‚Äù status, I conducted my first personal annual review.</p>

<p>The exercise was motivating, clarifying, and stress-reducing. It brought closure to 2022, helped me recompile a lot of what I learned, and gave me a firm handle on how I want to navigate 2023.</p>

<p>Here are a <a href="https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-personal-annual-review" target="_blank">couple</a> <a href="https://www.justinwelsh.me/blog/setting-anti-goals" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://tim.blog/2021/12/27/past-year-review/" target="_blank">resources</a> that I cherry picked from to structure my annual review if you‚Äôre interested in doing your own. Highly recommend.</p>

<p>I selected a few pieces of my review to expand upon for this post. Let‚Äôs dive in!</p>

<h2 id="2022-goal-review">2022 Goal Review</h2>

<p>2022 was my first year of setting and tracking specific goals for the year. I tried to limit big goals to 1 or 2, and tacked on a few easier ones. Despite not hitting all of them, they kept me very focused during my day-to-day‚Ä¶ constantly asking myself whether things were truly necessary to advance me towards one of these goals.</p>

<p>‚úÖ <strong>Read 12 books.</strong> I discovered audiobooks and blew this one out of the water.</p>

<p>‚úÖ <strong>Re-read 2 books.</strong></p>

<p>‚úÖ <strong>Launch personal blog.</strong> We know how that turned out!</p>

<p>‚ùå <strong>Build an app that I or my friends use.</strong> Overly ambitious given the state of my coding skillset.</p>

<p>‚ùå <strong>Launch a revenue-generating startup.</strong> I‚Äôm coming to find that things take MUCH longer than expected.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-already-knew-but-learned-through-experience-in-2022">Things I already knew, but ‚Äúlearned‚Äù through experience in 2022</h2>

<p>When you experience something for the first time that you already knew was a thing, it can give you a new appreciation for or understanding of that thing. Thinking about my year through this lens was a fun exercise, so I plan to do this every year going forward. Here are my big ones from 2022:</p>

<p class="sub-section">Burnout is real</p>

<p>I‚Äôve always thought of relentless energy and motivation as one of my greatest strengths. I‚Äôve heard people talk about how motivation comes in waves, but I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to never have experienced that. Until 2022, I can‚Äôt think of a time when my motivation ever really wanned.</p>

<p>I think it was a combination of launching a startup, working a full time job, learning to code, and just being in my early thirties that caused me to experience real burnout for the first time. Burnout was this thing that I always heard about, but just assumed didn‚Äôt apply to me, so I never really thought about how to avoid or manage it.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to put the feeling into words, but my tangible sense of motivation vanished for a period during early 2022. Not great.</p>

<p>The good news is that it forced me to take a break and relax. Sure enough, the motivation came back after a few weeks. The whole experience was unpleasant enough to learn a few lessons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Trying to be productive all the time is counterproductive</li>
  <li>Breaks are incredibly important</li>
  <li>Accomplishing a little bit each day is more sustainable and effective in the long run than trying to chain together massively productive long hour workdays</li>
</ol>

<p>I plan to be more mindful of these in 2023. I‚Äôm not an invincible 20 year old anymore! (although hopefully I look back on these days as being an invincible 30 year old üòé)</p>

<p class="sub-section">Depression is real</p>

<p>2022 was my first year experiencing proper depression. Until I reached my early 30s, I‚Äôve always been a consistently happy and energetic guy. Objectively, my life has been and is very good, and 2022 was full of many great experiences. Nonetheless, a confluence of factors related to my career and lifestyle sent me into a funk.</p>

<p>For a good portion of the year, I was pretty consistently sad (or at least just not happy) whenever there wasn‚Äôt a positive exogenous stressor in my life like going on a trip, going out with friends, or visiting family. There were definitely more bad days than good ones in 2022, which was kind of a shocking realization.</p>

<p>The lows often hurt more than the highs feel good, and the intensity of depression still takes up a disproportionate amount of my memory of 2022.</p>

<p>Again, like burnout, I always knew that depression was a thing, but kind of just assumed it wouldn‚Äôt happen to me. Experience makes you appreciate it for what it is.</p>

<p>I finally started going to therapy (after MUCH persuasion from Sarah). It‚Äôs early days, but talking to someone who is just there to listen and react objectively seems to help, and I‚Äôm in a pretty good headspace going into 2023. Who woulda thunk!</p>

<p class="sub-section">Sales is hard</p>

<p><strong>It is shockingly difficult to get people to part with their money.</strong> I could have told you that a year ago, but in 2022, I experienced it first hand trying to win early customers for my startup.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve always thought of myself as a good salesperson since I have an innate ability to get other people excited about things. When I‚Äôm excited about something, people are generally convinced and become excited about it too.</p>

<p>But I finally got a reality check: in a pure sales context, with no company, brand, product or reputation behind you, the bar is so much higher. The entire demeanor of the room changes when it comes time for the prospect to actually part with their money, or even just agree to something. The creativity of excuses I received never ceased to amaze me.</p>

<p>Alas, a lesson in entrepreneurship being about getting people to take action (and having a high rejection tolerance!)</p>

<p class="sub-section">Hiring is hard</p>

<p>I was intimately involved in the process to hire my replacement after resigning at work. This was much harder than I expected.</p>

<p>I spent the first decade of my career swinging through the jungles of finance, which involved many highly competitive interview processes. From where I was sitting back then, it always seemed like getting hired was the real challenge and that hiring companies had their pick of the lot.</p>

<p>It was eye opening to experience the <strong><em>pressure</em></strong> of finding the right candidate.</p>

<p>As a candidate, the consequences of not getting any individual job are inherently limited since you can always interview with another company. But <strong><em>hiring</em></strong> the wrong person can be value subtracting and negatively impact the company in a big way.</p>

<p>And if you do get it wrong, the problem cannot be resolved quickly given the time it takes to conclude someone is not a good fit, run another search/interview process, and onboard the replacement. Searching for and interviewing candidates is a very considered process, and there is a lot of pressure to hire the right person. More than I anticipated.</p>

<p>Again, I could have told you this a year ago, but experiencing the higher stakes really hit it home for me.</p>

<p><strong>A few additional takeaways:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The talent pool was worse than I expected.</strong> I always felt like my finance interview processes were super competitive and that I swimming in an ocean of uber-qualified candidates. Sitting on the other side of the table, I was disappointed by the majority of candidates we saw. Clearly a case of the grass being greener on the other side. Regardless of whether it‚Äôs a buyer‚Äôs or seller‚Äôs labor market, it‚Äôs competitive on both sides of the table.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I used to think it was unfair to not get feedback</strong> on why I didn‚Äôt advance to the next round of interviews. I see now that it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to give every candidate feedback on why they didn‚Äôt advance. This is due to both time constraints and passing on many candidates for something as simple as a poor case study submission early in the process. I still tried to pass along feedback to as many as I could.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hiring biases are real.</strong> I was hiring for a client-facing role where excellent verbal and written English is critical. Non-native English speakers (or those without excellent English) are at a de facto disadvantage, regardless of how talented or hard-working they may be. This can come through during interviews and in written assessments, and it is unfortunately difficult to mentally adjust for.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="sub-section">American Ninja Warrior is hard</p>

<p>I encountered a random ninja warrior park when I was visiting Tel Aviv this past summer. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and tried almost every obstacle. Impossible!</p>

<p>I knew it was hard, but experiencing it gave me new respect for those warriors.</p>

<h2 id="best-books-i-read-in-2022">Best books I read in 2022</h2>

<p>Not part of my annual review, but I felt compelled to share these bangers.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CCP2VWX/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&amp;tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20" target="_blank"><strong>Burn Rate</strong></a>. This is a book about mental illness under the cover of the Bonobos origin story. I have a new appreciation for the implications of bipolar disorder. Easily the most fascinating book I read in 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended-ebook/dp/B014DUR7L2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2PPJ2HCTPE287&amp;keywords=never+split+the+difference&amp;qid=1673415614&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=never+split+the+differ%2Cdigital-text%2C463&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Never Split The Difference</strong></a>. Recommended to me by a good friend as the ‚Äúbest negotiating book he‚Äôs ever read‚Äù. While this is the only negotiating book I‚Äôve read, it was excellent‚Ä¶ to be referenced for years to come. It was written by the former head of hostage negotiation for the FBI and is full of high stakes stories of real life negotiations. Super practical. ‚ÄúHow am I supposed to do that?!‚Äù (if you know, you know)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Music-Got-Free-Obsession-ebook/dp/B00OZ0TKL6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2E1P5RG83PUME&amp;keywords=how+music+got+free&amp;qid=1673415571&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=how+music+got+fr%2Cdigital-text%2C435&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>How Music Got Free</strong></a>. A detailed account of the digital piracy revolution of the late 1990s and 2000s. A fun trip down memory lane to my days using Kazaa and Limewire in middle school. Spyware, anyone?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Who-Michael-Ovitz-ebook/dp/B07B2HS77M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=20SA29K9QVPYF&amp;keywords=who+is+michael+ovitz&amp;qid=1673415644&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=who+is+michael+ovitz%2Cdigital-text%2C396&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Who Is Michael Ovitz?</strong></a> The memoir of a Hollywood super-agent. Especially interesting if you‚Äôre into movies and entertainment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tokyo-Vice-American-Reporter-Vintage-ebook/dp/B002RYXA0Y/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1IBXGG4XTWLYQ&amp;keywords=tokyo+vice&amp;qid=1673415668&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=tokyo+vice%2Cdigital-text%2C414&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><strong>Tokyo Vice</strong></a>. Tales from a American reporter covering the police beat in 1990s Japan. It‚Äôs an unbelievable story, and the author is a great storyteller. Beware, it gets dark.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="2023-goal-setting">2023 Goal Setting</h2>

<p>Working through my 2022 annual review inspired me to be even more deliberate about setting goals for 2023. Publishing them online seemed like a good way to hold myself accountable üí™.</p>

<p>I tried to set a few big goals that 1) are important to me, and 2) serve as milestones to achieving even bigger goals in the future. For each big goal, I also set a handful of ‚Äú<a href="https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-annual-planning-guide" target="_blank">checkpoint goals</a>‚Äù and put some systems in place to set myself up to hit them (e.g. 1 hour of coding, 4x per week).</p>

<p>I also set some simple reading and writing goals just to keep me on course. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to nail in 2023:</p>

<p>üéØ <strong>Write 6 blog posts.</strong> 1 per quarter felt like too little, 1 per month felt like too much.</p>

<p>üéØ <strong>Read 13 new books.</strong></p>

<p>üéØ <strong>Re-read 2 books.</strong></p>

<p>üéØ <strong>Achieve full shoulder width body squat with heels on floor.</strong> My ankle mobility sucks. This will set the foundation to achieve more advanced fitness goals down the road (see below).</p>

<p>üéØ <strong>Build an app that solves a problem for me.</strong> I have a side project I‚Äôm working on. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>üéØ <strong>Get 10 paying customers for my startup.</strong> Big goal #1. 10 customers would represent proof-of-concept and significant revenue, but it‚Äôs not completely outlandish. This also sets me up to achieve big goal #2‚Ä¶</p>

<p>üéØ <strong>Raise money for my startup.</strong> Big goal #2. Successfully raising in 2023 is a good barometer for our targeted level of growth and is required to scale into 2024 and beyond.</p>

<p>I piggy-backed off this annual goal-setting inspiration to set some longer term fitness goals as well. There is no ‚Äúdue date‚Äù on these. Just guiding North Stars for what I‚Äôm working towards long term:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Goal</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Rationale</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>20 pull ups (dead hang)</td>
      <td>Upper body strength</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Deadlift body weight 10 reps</td>
      <td>Total body strength</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eOrqGTpv6o" target="_blank">Nordic curl</a></td>
      <td>Posterior strength</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hang from a bar - 2 min</td>
      <td>Grip strength</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wall sit - 2 min</td>
      <td>Lower body strength</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDcniqddTeE" target="_blank">pistol squat</a> each leg</td>
      <td>Lower body mobility</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn8mqlG0nkE" target="_blank">Overhead squat</a> body weight 1 rep</td>
      <td>Total body strength/mobility</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5 min cycle w/watt output at 1.5x body weight</td>
      <td>Cardiovascular fitness</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I anticipate these taking several years to achieve at a pace that will avoid injury. Off we go.</p>

<h2 id="a-cool-thing-i-discovered-in-2022">A cool thing I discovered in 2022</h2>

<p>I thought I‚Äôd leave you with this. <a href="https://www.futureme.org/letters/new" target="_blank">Futureme</a>. This website lets you send a letter to your future self (they email you the letter at a specified time in the future).</p>

<p>I wrote a letter to myself in five years and one to myself in 10 years. I plan to write one to my 80 year old self as well. Pretty cool!</p>

<hr />

<p>And there it is. A little late getting this one out, but we did it. I hope you found something useful or inspiring in this post. Onward to discovering more cool things in 2023!</p>
