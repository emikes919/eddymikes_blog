title: Why I started this blog

I’ve been thinking about starting a blog for a while, but here I am sitting at Hong Kong International Airport with two hours until my flight to New York, and something just came over me, so I started typing away. Here goes nothing.

I started this blog for three reasons: **1) clear writing = clear thinking, 2) exploring unknown unknowns, and 3) accountability.** 

### **Clear writing = clear thinking**

I spend the vast majority of my intellectually demanding time consuming information and content, rather than producing/creating it. Books, podcasts, blogs, articles, my Twitter feed, YouTube videos… it’s pretty much a one way street of information input. 

All that information represents some of the building blocks of the ideas I have and views I form.

Translating ideas from thoughts in one’s head into comprehendible written words challenges one to more deeply understand what they think. It’s amazing how I’ll think I know something and try to write it out, and that exercise reveals how hollow that thinking can actually be sometimes. There are other areas of life where I’m writing - occasionally at my day job, for startups/side projects I’ve worked on, etc., but it’s pretty infrequent. Forcing myself to write more stimulates a another part of my brain (if I was on the fence about that before, writing this first post proves it to me.) 

This blog is a pursuit of clearer, deeper thinking about the things that interest me.

I have a rough idea of what I plan to write about (entrepreneurship/business, health & fitness, learning, productivity, travel/living abroad, anything else I come to be interested in), but I’m excited to see where this goes. Which brings me to my next reason…

### **Exploring unknown unknowns**

Ideas beget ideas. I don’t understand the brain chemistry behind this, they just do. I don’t know what I’ll uncover about myself or what ideas will occur to me by challenging myself to write more, but I know I’ll uncover something. It would be cool to see what that’s all about.

### **Accountability**

I could just write in a journal, but there’s something about the act of posting something online for the world to see. We’re not talking about high stakes here, but it does hold me to a higher standard. The internet is [forever](https://web.archive.org/), so there’s an incentive to really think through what I’m writing. This ties into clear writing = clear thinking.

Those are the main reasons, but this is also another fun coding challenge! I’m picking up programming on the side (I’ll probably write about that), and a personal blog or website is a great early practical application of that skillset. This blog is completely self-developed and hosted using GitHub Pages, Jekyll, basic HTML/CSS, and Namecheap.

As an aside, despite having read it for some time, I only just noticed that a high school friend of mine has been running his [awesome blog](https://blas.com/essays/) for what appears to be the exact same reasons! One inspiration point to you, my friend.

### **What’s in a name?**

“E Mikes”, “Eddy Mikes” or many variations thereof was given to me as a nickname in high school and it has stuck ever since. Keepin’ it rolling!

And BOOM! First blog post complete. Stay tuned for more, I hope you enjoy reading!
