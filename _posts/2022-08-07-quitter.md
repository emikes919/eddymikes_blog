I just quit my job.

How’s that for a hook? 

No, it wasn’t as rash of a decision as that one-liner makes it seem. It's something I’ve been ruminating on for a while, with growing intensity over the past 18-24 months.

It feels like I'm at an inflection point in my career. Having worked in finance since I graduated college in 2013, it only dawned on me two or so years ago that I’ve been on a journey away from finance and towards entrepreneurship.

So where did it all begin?

I got into investment banking out of college for a few reasons. I don’t know if they were the right ones, they probably weren’t: 

1. I wanted to learn a lot (about anything, just a lot)
2. I wanted to “credentialize” my CV
3. Money
4. My friends were doing it, and I identified with the culture

Three out of four reasons revolve around one theme: preserving optionality. Knowing nothing about finance and having no idea what I wanted to do in life, that rationale seemed somewhat sensible, so I dove in. Almost a decade later, it’s clear that I was wearing blinders preventing me from being intellectually honest about who I am, where my true interests lie, and what I (maybe) should be doing with my life... stubbornly “preserving optionality” at all costs without thinking critically about these things. I can chalk it up to immaturity, lack of experience, or plain old not knowing until I know, but here we are.

Looking back on the last 9 years moving through roles in various sub-sectors of finance, two things occurred to me: 

1. **I was never organically super excited about what I was doing.** Every manifesto ever written will tell you requirement #1 for being happy and successful in life is to love what you do. Ask anyone who knows me - I am an *extremely* enthusiastic person by nature. This never came through in my work. Big red flag🚩
2. **My absolutely highest performing state occurred when I was out of a job and out there hustling** to get hired by companies that felt out of my reach (in one case after already having quit my job). My sheer levels of cognition and drive were on another level. I’ve started a handful of side hustles and projects and noticed the exact same thing. Something about the lack of a salary safety net combined with pure organic interest unlocked something within me. This isn’t all that surprising, but sometimes it just hits home after the fact.

This ignited some serious introspection. Why was I spending my time this way, swinging through the jungles of finance with tunnel vision? How can I better spend my time to maximize my happiness and potential?

Being honest with myself, the answer to the first question came pretty easily: I was working my way through finance because it was the lucrative thing to do. The safe thing to do. The thing to do.

It’s safe to say that’s not a great way to go through life if one can help it.

The second question, however, took me deeper down the introspection rabbit hole. What am I good at? What do I even like? What the heck do I even want in life?!

Two years of exploring what I think I want in life can be distilled down to:

- **Freedom.** Not being a slave to my job. Living the lifestyle I want. Living in a state of pure meritocracy.
- **The ability to travel, live a comfortable healthy life, and have a big family.**
- **Do something impactful.** Having some sort of direct positive impact on other people or the world.

But what am I good at? More importantly, what am I good at that is relatively unqiue? 

In an effort to prevent this post from becoming one big pat on the back, I'll leave it here: I energize others, I can [schlep](http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html){:target="_blank"} like the best of them, and I'm decisive (I can "pull trig", for better or worse).

So all of that is true, *and* I have the most fun and perform at my highest level when working and setting higher stakes for myself? 

**🚨Revelation Alert🚨**

**My career must align my strengths and desires.** These observations about my past and future led me straight to entrepreneurship.

I’ve toyed with many ideas for starting my own business since middle school, but never moved forward with anything, which is a bit strange since I was a little *too* comfortable with risk in my formative years. The desire was always there, and it’s finally clear that I was ignoring it for all the wrong reasons. It only took a decade in finance and deep reflection on who I am to convince myself that I can be a successful entrepreneur. 

Said differently, all the fancy introspection can probably be reduced down to a good old entrepreneurial itch.

Some itches must be scratched.

I’m currently working on a startup in Hong Kong, but even if I didn’t think this project was worth working on, I’d quit my job anyway. I have no shortage of ideas, I genuinely believe in my ability to figure it out, and I'm pretty incapable of delivering the required level of focus when my peak mental hours are consumed by a day job. Maintaining the status quo is anything but positioning myself to get lucky.

We shall see. It’s not all exciting and glamorous. The highs of achievement are high, but the lows of the pursuit are very low. Self-sustaining and pursuing what I want in life is likely to be far more challenging than anything I’ve done.

BUT… People tend to overestimate risk, and sometimes you gotta burn the boats and bet on yourself. Away we go.
